						She was a simple washerwomen all through her life. She didn't go to school after 6th grade. She never married. By the time she passed away at the age of 91 she was honoured by world leaders. She was

						awarded an honorary doctorate from Harvard University and University of Mississippi.  She met

						President and received an honorary award. She appeared on most TV networks. She was written about in months

							My dear friends, ever since she was a young woman she would take the nickels, dimes and

							quarters that she earned out of washing people’s laundry, go to the local bank and make	

							daily and seemingly insignificant deposits.

							She made contributions every day. Days slipped into weeks. Weeks into months. Months into

							years and years into decades. 
						</p>
						<p> 
							One day when she was 87 a bank official asked her

							“Oseola, how are you today?”. She said “Good”.

							“Do you know how much money you have accumulated so far by your daily contributions that

							you have been making over the course of your life?”

							“No. how much?”, Oseola replied.

							“Quarter of a million dollars!”, the bank official said.

							She was a simple woman. She didn’t know how much money that was. The man behind the

							counter took out 10 dimes and said “Oseola, these ten coins represent your money”. Please tell

							me what do you want to do with this money?

							She pointed to the first Dime and said “I want you to give that to the Church”

							She pointed to the next three dimes and said, “I want you to give this to my nieces and nephews

							because I love them so much. For the remaining 6 dimes I have something special in my mind”.
						</p>
						<p>
							One month later the University of Mississippi received a cheque for $150K with hand written

							notes attached to it that simply said

							“I’d like you to set up a scholarship scheme for the poor African-American students who have

							never dreamt of higher education”.

							This act of humanity in the world where humanity was forgotten by people touched many lives

							in the country. The news spread across the country. 
						</p>
						<p>
							When the reporters asked her, “Do you have any wish for your life” which we can do.

							She said “I want to see a student who has benefited from this scholarship walking on the

							graduation stage”.

							One month before she passed away a student graduated who benefited by the scholarship.

						</p>
						<p>
							Oseola proved to the world,

							No matter how humble you are, you can add value to many lives

							No matter how humble you are, you can inspire many lives

							She proved to the world an ordinary person can do extraordinary things by doing little things

							every day.
